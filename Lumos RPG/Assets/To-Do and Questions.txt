Lumos RPG

Mouse vs controller ranged attack?
Controller does not target an enemy, therefore cannot auto move into range/attack.

Mouse (Current) - Click -> move into range -> attack
Mouse Alt 2  (Goal) - move with WASD, aim towards mouse cursor
Controller - shoot in either player forward direction, or "twin stick" aim direction

Ranged vs melee?  
Move into range then attack (range/melee basically same)
or infinite ranged projectiles? (range just attacks, melee move->attack)



Up next:
Abilities
Player Ranged attack (at mouse cursor, fires whenever, instead of having to click on enemy)
Fix 2d player sprite (can use FEH assets for now)
Make some 2d enemies to replace our 3d ones
Fix movement (3d)
Fix AI movement for 2d characters (need to revamp the dependacies and move methods)
Animations


Possiblities:
Occlusion? (see char behind objects)
More free/responsive movement (no turn time, etc)
Projectiles colliding is cool!
