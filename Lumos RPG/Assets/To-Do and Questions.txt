Lumos RPG

Mouse vs controller ranged attack?
Controller does not target an enemy, therefore cannot auto move into range/attack.

Mouse (Current) - Click -> move into range -> attack
Mouse Alt 2  (Goal) - move with WASD, aim towards mouse cursor
Controller - shoot in either player forward direction, or "twin stick" aim direction

Ranged vs melee?  
Move into range then attack (range/melee basically same)
or infinite ranged projectiles? (range just attacks, melee move->attack)



Up next:
*Player attack!  Enemy attack!  HP!
Enemies move towards player to attack?
Abilities


Possiblities:
Occlusion? (see char behind objects)
More free/responsive movement (no turn time, etc)
